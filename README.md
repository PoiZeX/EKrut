# EKrut System

## Intro 

EKrut is a semester mini-project focused on a food service application.

Technology Stack: The system employs a client-server architecture, leverages the OCSF framework, follows the ECB design pattern, utilizes MySQL for data storage, is hosted on GitHub, incorporates testing using JUnit and Jubula, and encompasses various generic software functionalities.


Project Phases: The project is divided into three sprints:

* Sprint 1: This phase covered requirements gathering, Use-Case diagram creation, acceptance testing, and the formulation of a To-Do list.

* Sprint 2: Activities included the development of an Activity diagram, Class diagram, Sequence diagram, Package diagram, and prototyping both client and server components along with the database.

* Sprint 3: The final sprint involved full implementation and project presentation.

Agile Development: Agile methodologies were followed, with each sprint lasting 3-4 weeks. Stand-up meetings were held twice a week to ensure effective progress.

Testing: The project includes unit tests and Jubula tests to maintain code quality and functionality.
